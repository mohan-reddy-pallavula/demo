# Various face detection models :
Other than body-pix ,PGN models , we applied four other models to detect the person  faces in cctv videos

1. Opencv + Haar cascade Face Detection Model ,
2. Dlib + HOG based face Detector,
3. Dlib + CNN based face Detector,
4. MTCNN Face Detector.

we have two folders which are HarrCascade+Dlib(face-detector) , MTCNN 

1. HarrCascade+Dlib folder consists implementation of Harrcascade face detection model , Hog based face Detector , CNN based face detector .
2. MTCNN folder consists of implementation of mtcnn model.
